*How to install and run Erigon 3 on Linux or Mac OS*

There are 3 options for running Erigon 3, listed from easiest to most difficult installation:

-   [Use pre-built binaries](/installation/prebuilt.md): Download and run the latest stable release of Erigon. This is the easiest option and requires no additional dependencies.
    
-   [Use Docker](/installation/docker.md): Run Erigon in a Docker container for isolation from the host system. This avoids dependencies but requires installing Docker.

-  [Build Erigon from source](/installation/build.md): Build the Erigon source code directly on your system. This is the most complex option and requires a working Go environment.
