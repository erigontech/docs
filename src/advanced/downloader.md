# Downloader
*Seeding/downloading historical data*

The Downloader is a service responsible for seeding and downloading historical data using the BitTorrent protocol. Data is stored in the form of immutable `.seg` files, known as **snapshots**. The Ethereum core instructs the Downloader to download specific files, identified by their unique info hashes, which include both block headers and block bodies. The Downloader then communicates with the BitTorrent network to retrieve the necessary files, as specified by the Ethereum core.

<div class="warning">

**Information**:

While all Erigon components are separable and can be run on different machines, the downloader must run on the same machine as Erigon to be able to share downloaded and seeded files.

</div>

Like many other Erigon components (txpool, sentry, rpc daemon) `downloader` can be running [integrated into Erigon](#start-erigon-with-snapshots-support) or as a [separate process](#running-downloader-as-a-separate-process).

## Start Erigon with snapshots support


Downloader is running by default inside Erigon, where it can be configured with the `--snapshots` flag:

```bash
./build/bin/erigon  --snapshots 
```

The `--snapshots` flag is compatible with the `--prune.mode` flag.

When you start the Erigon node with the --snapshots flag, it allows you to control the behavior of the Downloader component, such as:

- Enabling or disabling the Downloader component
- Configuring the Downloader to use specific snapshots or directories
- Controlling the seeding and downloading of snapshots

## Running downloader as a separate process

Before using a separate downloader process the executable must be built:

```bash
cd erigon
make downloader
```
Downloader can then be started as independent process, for example:

```bash
./build/bin/downloader --downloader.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9093 --torrent.port=42068
```

- `--downloader.api.addr` is for internal communication with Erigon;
- `--torrent.port=42068` is for public BitTorrent protocol listen;
- The default download speed is 16mb/sec. You can increase/limit the network usage by adding the flags `--torrent.download.rate=512mb --torrent.upload.rate=512mb` 
- On startup Erigon sends list of `.torrent` files to Downloader and waits for 100% download completion
    ```bash
    ./build/bin/erigon --snapshots --downloader.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9093
    ```
- Use `--snap.keepblocks=true` to not delete retired blocks from DB.
- Any network/chain can start with snapshot sync:
    - The node will only download snapshots that are registered in the next repository, which can be found at <https://github.com/erigontech/erigon-snapshot>.
    - The node will periodically clear out old blocks from the database by copying them into snapshots of 1,000-block size. It will then merge these snapshots into larger ranges until it reaches snapshots of 500,000 blocks. Once this process is complete, the node will automatically begin creating new snapshots.".

## Creation of a new network or bootnode

When creating a new network or bootnode, it's possible that new snapshots may need to be created and seeded. To do this, you'll need to create the snapshots using the following command:

```bash
erigon snapshots retire --datadir=<your_datadir>
```

This will create .torrent files that the Downloader can use to seed the new snapshots. The output format is compatible with <https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon-snapshot>.

To change the size of the snapshots, add the following flags:

```bash
--from=0 --to=1_000_000 --segment.size=500_000
```

Then, use the downloader command to rebuild the snapshots:

```bash
./build/bin/downloader torrent_hashes --rebuild --datadir=<your_datadir>
```

The Downloader will automatically seed the new snapshots.

Note that while Erigon is not required to seed snapshots, running Erigon with the --snapshots flag will also enable seeding.

## Additional info

When creating snapshots, you don't need a fully-synced Erigon node. In fact, you only need to complete a few initial stages of syncing. This allows you to start seeding snapshots without having to wait for a full sync.

To take advantage of this, you can use the following flags to start syncing, but only seed the first few stages:

- `STOP AFTER STAGE=Senders`: this flag tells Erigon to stop syncing after reaching the "Senders" stage. This allows you to seed the snapshots without waiting for the full sync.
- `./build/bin/erigon --snapshots=false --datadir=<your_datadir>`: this command starts the Erigon node in snapshot-only mode, which allows it to seed the snapshots without waiting for the full sync.

However, for security reasons, it's highly recommended to have a fully-synced Erigon node. This ensures that all data is up-to-date and secure.

### Indexing Snapshots Before Seeding

Before seeding snapshots, they must be indexed by Erigon. While indexing is not required for seeding, it's recommended to run the following command to ensure that snapshots are properly indexed:

```bash
./build/bin/erigon snapshots index --datadir=<your_datadir>
```

This step is not required for seeding, but it's essential for using snapshots effectively.

## Architecture

Snapshots can be created in four ways:

1. **Automated creation**: Erigon can create new .torrent files using the downloader.Download RPC method.
2. **Manual creation**: Erigon can create new .seg files, which are then scanned by the Downloader to create .torrent files.
3. **Manual seeding**: .torrent files can be manually copied from another server or restored from backup.
4. **Manual indexing**: .seg files can be manually copied and indexed by the Downloader.

**Erigon**'s role in the snapshot creation process:
- Connects to the Downloader and shares the list of hashes.
- Waits for the download of all snapshots.
- Creates `.idx` files (secondary indices) when .seg files are available.
- Switches to normal staged sync after downloading all snapshots.
- Ensures that snapshot downloading happens only once, even if new Erigon versions are released.

**Downloader**'s role in the snapshot creation process:
- Reads .torrent files and downloads the contents described by them.
- Uses a list of trackers to download files (see ./trackers/embed.go).
- Automatically seeds the downloaded files.

# Technical Details

To prevent attacks, `.idx` files are created with random seeds, ensuring that each node has a unique `.idx` file (but the same `.seg` file).
If `.seg` files are manually added or removed, the `<your_datadir>/snapshots/db` folder must also be updated.

## Verifying .seg file checksums

Use the `downloader --verify` command to check the checksums of the `.seg` files. Compare the checksums with those of the current `.torrent` files.

## Faster Rsync

Use the following command to perform a faster rsync:
```bash
rsync -aP --delete -e "ssh -T -o Compression=no -x"
```

## Release Details

To start automatic commits of new hashes to the master branch:
```bash
crontab -e @hourly cd <erigon_source_dir> && ./cmd/downloader/torrent_hashes_update.sh <your_datadir> <network_name> 1>&2 2>> ~/erigon_cron.log
```

This command pushes the changes to the master branch automatically before each release.
