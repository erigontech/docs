Erigon is an efficient Ethereum implementation designed for speed, modularity, and optimization. By default, it functions as a full node, utilizing technologies like staged sync, efficient state storage, and database compression.

With Erigon 3 the default configuration shifts from archive node to full node, enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and versatility for a wider range of users. Archive nodes remain available for developers and researchers needing full historical data, while the full node offers faster sync times and lower resource usage for everyday operations.
