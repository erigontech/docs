# Tools

Erigon offers a range of tools to enhance your experience and provide valuable assistance when:

1. Troubleshooting issues with your local or remote Erigon node using our [Diagnostics Tool](/tools/introduction.md), which helps you identify and resolve problems efficiently.
2. Exploring the blockchain with [Otterscan](/tools/otterscan.md), a feature-rich EVM block explorer that allows you to browse and analyze blockchain data with ease.

Both tools are developed internally and are fully supported for our users.
